  optional arguments:
    -h, --help            show this help message and exit
    -s SCHEMA, --schema SCHEMA
                          schema name to export. Can be specified more than
                          once. For each schema a directorywill be created on
                          the filesystem.
    -t TABLE, --table TABLE
                          tables to export. Can be specified more than once, if
                          no schema specified, then tables will be exported from
                          the current user specified by <oracle_logon>
    --sql SQL             SQL Statement to execute to produce CSV. Data is
                          printed to STDOUT
    -f FILE, --file FILE  file to read the SQL Statement from. If FILE is '-'
                          then input is read from STDIN
    -xc COLUMN, --exclude-column COLUMN
                          specify columns to exclude. Can be specified more than
                          once.
    --scn SCN             specify System Change Number during exporting. This
                          will export data with AS OF SCN clause.
    --null-as NULL_AS     by default columns with NULL values exported as
                          nothing. This parameter allows to override this. For
                          MySQL use '\N'
    --array-size ARRAY_SIZE
                          set the fetch buffer size. Default is: 16384 rows
    --no-header           omit header row with column names
    --crlf                use DOS format for line ending (\r + \n). By default,
                          UNIX format is used (\n)
    --version             show program's version number and exit

Installation and Usage
----------------------
Make sure that you have the ``cx_Oracle`` module installed. If not - 
run ``easy_install cx_Oracle`` or ``pip install cx_Oracle`` depending
on the package manager installed on your system as csv_exp depends on it.

Then just copy ``csv_exp.py`` somewhere accessisble, like your ``~/bin`` folder 
or ``/usr/local/bin``.

Examples
--------

- Export whole schema. This will create a number of ``SCHEMA.*.csv`` files in
  the current directory::
    
    csv_exp.py -s SCHEMA user/pwd@ORCL

- Exporting several tables (assuming that user ``scott`` has grant to select
  from ``SCHEMA1``)::

    csv_exp.py -t TABLE1 -t SCHEMA1.TABLE4 scott/tiger@ORCL

- Exporting the result of SQL execution. Result of ``--sql`` are not being 
  saved to any file, but output to STDOUT by default, so you'll need to
  redirect the output somewhere::

    csv_exp.py --sql "SELECT * FROM SCHEMA.MY_VIEW" scott/tiger > output.csv
